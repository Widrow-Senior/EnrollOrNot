RWE Cohort Criteria (Example Study: New Statin Initiation and LDL-C Response)

STUDY AIM
Assess LDL-C reduction after new initiation of moderate/high-intensity statin therapy using routinely collected outpatient EHR data.

DEFINITIONS
- Index date: date of statin initiation (documented in the outpatient clinical note).
- Baseline window: day -60 to day 0 relative to index date.
- Follow-up window: day +56 to day +112 relative to index date.

INCLUSION CRITERIA (CLINICAL)
1) Age 35–80 years (inclusive) at index date.
2) Diagnosis of hyperlipidemia (or mixed dyslipidemia) documented in the clinical note.
3) Baseline LDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL within the baseline window.
4) New initiation of a moderate- or high-intensity statin at index date:
   - No statin use documented in the 180 days prior to index date.

INCLUSION CRITERIA (TECHNICAL DATA REQUIREMENTS)
5) Complete demographics in the clinical note: patient_id, age, sex present (non-missing).
6) Baseline lipid panel and safety labs within baseline window:
   - LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides, ALT, AST, creatinine, and eGFR.
7) Follow-up LDL-C measurement available within follow-up window (single value is sufficient).
8) Encounter evidence:
   - ≥1 outpatient encounter in the 180 days before index date, AND
   - ≥1 outpatient encounter in the 120 days after index date.
9) Standardized lab units and formatting:
   - Lipids in mg/dL, ALT/AST in U/L, creatinine in mg/dL, eGFR in mL/min/1.73 m².
   - Dates must be ISO-8601 (YYYY-MM-DD).
   - Numeric fields must be parseable as numbers (no mixed text).

EXCLUSION CRITERIA
A) Pregnancy at index date.
B) Severe hepatic impairment at baseline: ALT > 3× ULN (ULN=56 U/L) OR AST > 3× ULN (ULN=40 U/L).
C) Advanced kidney disease: eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² at baseline, dialysis, or kidney transplant.
D) Major cardiovascular event within 3 months before index (MI, stroke, coronary revascularization).
E) Documented statin intolerance leading to discontinuation (within the note).
F) Participation in an interventional clinical trial within the last 3 months.

NOTES
- This dataset contains synthetic data and for development/testing only.
- Eligibility label is based on BOTH clinical criteria and technical data completeness/validity requirements.
