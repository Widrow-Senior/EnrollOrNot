dapa-hf-001	0. A 67-year-old White man with a 3-year history of symptomatic chronic heart failure due to ischemic cardiomyopathy presents for routine follow-up. 1. He has NYHA class III dyspnea on exertion and occasional orthopnea but no recent worsening of symptoms. 2. Echocardiography one month ago showed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30% with global hypokinesis. 3. NT-proBNP measured last week was 2,100 pg/mL, clearly elevated. 4. His estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is 45 mL/min/1.73 m? (CKD-EPI), and serum potassium is 4.5 mmol/L. 5. Current medications include an ACE inhibitor, a beta-blocker, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, and a loop diuretic, in doses consistent with guideline-directed medical therapy for HFrEF. 6. He has no history of type 1 diabetes mellitus and has never received an SGLT2 inhibitor. 7. Blood pressure at today’s visit is 118/72 mmHg without symptoms of hypotension. 8. There has been no hospitalization for acute decompensated heart failure in the last 6 months and no myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, transient ischemic attack, coronary revascularization, or cardiac device implantation within the last 12 months. 9. There is no evidence of restrictive, hypertrophic, or constrictive cardiomyopathy, active myocarditis, or significant uncorrected valvular disease, and he has no symptomatic bradycardia or high-grade AV block. 10. The patient is able to provide informed consent and is willing to comply with all study visits and procedures.

She has experienced exertional dyspnea and reduced exercise tolerance for approximately 18 months, currently described as NYHA class II–III. 2. She recalls having an echocardiogram about 9 months ago, but the exact left ventricular ejection fraction is not documented in the available records, and the report is not accessible at today’s visit. 3. No recent NT-proBNP or BNP measurements are available in the electronic medical record. 4. Her primary care notes mention “mild chronic kidney disease,” but there are no recent laboratory values from which to calculate eGFR; the most recent serum creatinine is from more than a year ago. 5. She is taking a beta-blocker and an ACE inhibitor at moderate doses, but no MRA or loop diuretic has been prescribed, and it is unclear whether she is on fully optimized guideline-directed therapy. 6. She does not have a history of type 1 diabetes and has never taken any SGLT2 inhibitor. 7. There is no documentation of recent MI, unstable angina, stroke, TIA, coronary revascularization, or device implantation in the last year, but this has not been systematically confirmed. 8. Current blood pressure is 124/80 mmHg without symptoms of hypotension. 9. She states that she would be willing to provide informed consent and attend trial visits, but further diagnostic clarification (including updated echocardiography, NT-proBNP, and renal function) has been recommended. 10.
